        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His equation E = mc<sup>2</sup> is known worldwide and revolutionized our understanding of the universe.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>
            Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics and physics and studied at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland. After graduating, he worked as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office.
